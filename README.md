# CIFAR-10-Convolution-Neural-Network--Classification
### Here I have tried to train and test the CIFAR-10 dataset.
### About the Dataset:
### 1)The dataset contains 60,000 images.
### 2)Each image is of 32x32 pixels.
### 3)There are in total 10 classes of images namely:
###   >Airplane
###   >Car
###   >Duck
###   >Deer
###   >Dog
###   >Cat
###   >Horses
###   >frogs
###   >Ships
###   >Trucks
### 4)Each class has 6000 images.

### >The overall accuracy came out to be 75% which is considerably good keeping in mind the fact that it'll take around 90 hours to train to get an accuracy of 95% and that too on GPU.
### >Total time taken fo testing till 30 epochs was around 50 minutes without CUDA GPU.
### >With GPU time taken was around 7 to 8 minutes.
